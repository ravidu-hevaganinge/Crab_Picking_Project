# Crab_Picking_Project

The idea is to try to utilize a conservation law in order to create a PDE. This PDE can then be solved to yield a vector field. A point, representing the end effector of the robot can be traced on the vector field and the subsequent ordinary differential equation used to model the point in the vector field is the curve the robot will follow.
